# Cypher Tool

Welcome! This README will help you understand what our tool does.

## ðŸ“Œ What does the tool do?
This tool allows you to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages.  
It can be useful if you want to hide information or decode a message youâ€™ve received.  
Example: if you get a message that is written using reversed characters, you can run it through our tool to reveal the original content.

## âš™ How to use the tool

1. **Choose your action:**
    - `1` â€” Encrypt
    - `2` â€” Decrypt

2. **Choose the encryption/decryption method:**
    - `1` â€” **ROT13**  
      Shifts every letter by 13 positions in the alphabet.
    - `2` â€” **Reverse (Atbash)**  
      Replaces each letter with its "mirror" in the alphabet (A â†” Z, B â†” Y, etc.).
    - `3` â€” **Caesar cipher**  
      Asks you for a shift number and shifts every letter by that number.

3. **Enter your message** (non-alphabet characters will remain unchanged).
